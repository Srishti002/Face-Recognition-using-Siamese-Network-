# Face Recognition using Siamese Neural Network
## Introduction
This project is about face recognition using a Siamese Neural Network. 
Traditionally Siamese networks are using pairs of training samples such as anchor-positive and anchor-negative pairs. So this is kind a supervised type where we have labels anchor-positive as 1 and anchor-negative as 0.
But we can also use unsupervised approach here as positive training data are chosen within one dataset  based on their similarity score using cosine similarity with the anchor and negative training data are selected using the same criterion but from the separate dataset.

But in this project we will follow supervised approach.
